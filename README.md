# vCard Turbo

Keep your organization's contacts up to date by importing contacts
from vCard files located at remote servers.

You get new contacts and updates to existing contacts already on your
phone. _The app never overwrites existing contact data on your phone._

Save for granting the permission to access the address book, the app
never asks anything from you. This is a tool for importing lots of
contacts and you don't want to get bothered with questions about which
new fields for which contacts you actually want to import.

The app supports accessing vCard files with http(s), optionally with
basic authentication. It avoids unnecessary downloading if the remote
vCard file has not been changed since the last check.

There may be multiple sources for remote vCards. The app attempts to
download vCard files from all of them. You can disable individual
sources from importing, too.

## Contact importing algorithm

After downloading a remote vCard file, the app builds changesets from
the contact record data inside it.

An imported contact record is considered as new if there's no other
contact with the same name in the phone's address book (by comparing
records' first and last names). Such a contact gets added to the
address book as is.

A contact record with one matching name in the address book is
considered a candidate for possible changes in record fields. The app
marks a single-value-field (such as the job title) for addition if the
record has no existing value for it. For multi-value-fields (such as
phone numbers), any field with nonexisting values gets marked for
addition. The labels of multi-value-fields are ignored.

If there are multiple name matches for an imported contact record, the
app ignores the record.

After building the changesets, the app applies them to the address
book.

The order of vCard sources matters: the app imports contact records by
going through the sources from top to bottom. Contact records from the
later sources might get ignored because a former source filled in the
data already. For example, if the first source has a job title value
for a person, then the app chooses that value and ignores the possible
job title values for the same person from other sources.

## Technical features

* The app utilizes HEAD request to avoid unnecessary downloading of the
  remote file by checking if the Etag or Modified-Since response
  header has changed since the last import.
* The import job downloads and parses each vCard source asynchronously
  and in parallel (if the system lets it). The application of
  changesets to the address book is done serially.
* The name and URL fields in the vCard source detail view validate the
  input asynchronously, with throttling and switch-latest
  functionality (ensuring that only the response corresponding to the
  last URL validation request gets counted in, tackling the problem of
  interleaved responses).
* Uses [Futures](https://github.com/tkareine/ToyFuture) for handling
  complex asynchronous tasks.
* Stores nonsensitive user data to `NSUserDefaults`, JSON encoded.
* Stores sensitive user data (usernames and passwords, currently) to
  the phone's keychain, JSON encoded.
* The progress bar shown while importing has granularity up to the
  download progress of each individual vCard source. Record changeset
  application gets counted in, too.
